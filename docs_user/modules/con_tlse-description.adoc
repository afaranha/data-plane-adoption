= TLS Everywhere

If the Director deployment was deployed with TLS Everywhere, FreeIPA (IDM) is used
for providing services with certificates. Certmonger is installed on all hosts,
which provisions the certificates for services running on the host.

The new Operator based deployment uses cert-manager to provision the certificates.
Instructions will be provided on how to retrieve the root CA from IPA and copy it
over to the new environment.

Because the same root CA is used to generate new certs, the currently used trust
chain doesn't have to be modified.

Note: The asumption is, that the new deployment will adopt the settings from the
old deployment, so in case TLS Everywhere is disabled, it won't be enabled on
the new deployment.
