= Adoption limitations

The adoption process does not support the following features:

* {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} multi-cell deployments
* Fast Data path
* instanceHA
* Auto-scaling
* DCN
* Designate
* Octavia

If you plan to adopt the {key_manager_first_ref} or a FIPs environment, review the following limitations:

* The {key_manager} does not yet support all of the crypto plug-ins available in {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}.
* When you adopt a {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS environment to {rhos_acro} {rhos_curr_ver}, your adopted cluster remains a FIPS cluster. There is no option to change the FIPS status during adoption. If your cluster is FIPS-enabled, you must deploy a FIPS {rhocp_long} cluster to adopt your {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} FIPS control plane. For more information about enabling FIPS in {OpenShiftShort}, see link:{defaultOCPURL}/installing/installation-overview#installing-fips[Support for FIPS cryptography] in the {OpenShiftShort} _Installing_ guide.
