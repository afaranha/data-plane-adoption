= Limitations for adopting the {block_storage}

Before you begin the {block_storage_first_ref} adoption, review the following limitations:

* There is no global `nodeSelector` option for all {block_storage} volumes. You must specify the `nodeSelector` for each back end.
* There are no global `customServiceConfig` or `customServiceConfigSecrets` options for all {block_storage} volumes. You must specify these options for each back end.
* Adoption of LVM back ends, where the volume data is stored in the Compute nodes, is not documented in this guide.
* Support for {block_storage} back ends that require kernel modules that are not included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not tested in {rhos_long}.
* Adoption of DCN/Edge deployment is not documented in this guide.
