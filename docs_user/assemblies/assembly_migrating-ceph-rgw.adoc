= Migrating {Ceph} RGW to external RHEL nodes

For Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) or dedicated Storage nodes, you must migrate the Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) daemons that are included in the {rhos_prev_long} Controller nodes into the existing external Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) nodes. The external RHEL nodes typically include the Compute nodes for an HCI environment or {Ceph} nodes. Your environment must have {Ceph} version 6 or later and be managed by `cephadm` or Ceph Orchestrator.
//* The undercloud is still available, and the nodes and networks are managed by {OpenStackPreviousInstaller}. kgilliga: This needs to be a prerequisite in a new module in the first chapter, e.g., "Ceph prerequisites".
